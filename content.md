The **3M Aura** is a line of disposable N95 respirators with a unique boat-style design produced by the 3M Company.  Outside of the United States, 3M Auras are sold as FFP2 or FFP3 respirators.

3M Aura may have higher fit test pass rates than typical disposable N95 respirators; this means an individual wearing it may be more likely to have a correct fit in the absence of a formal fit test.

In [a study in untrained individuals, the 3M Aura 1862+ had a fit test pass rate of 82.5%](https://openres.ersjournals.com/content/6/4/00581-2020), whereas the typical N95 cup-style respirators had pass rates of 73%, 67%, and 23% (and the KN95 had a pass rate of 0%). In [a small study of 60 anaesthetists](https://asapublicaccess.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/AustralianAnaesthetist/Feature_Fittesting.pdf), the 3M Aura 1870+ had a 5/5 (100%) pass rate, compared to a pass rate of 3/7 (43%) for the 3M 8210 (typical N95 cup style) and a pass rate of 1/9 (11%) for other typical N95 respirators.
